### Issues

Feel free to open issues for problems you are having with the project! We will try to respond as fast as possible.

### Code 

If you want to contribute, try to establish contact to the current developer team to discuss your proposed change
first, so that you don't spend a lot of time
for nothing. 

The project is written in Python 3, using the infamous [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please feel 
free to break those guidelines if necessary.
 
For docstrings, we follow the [reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) style.

If you are leaving TODO comments, try to leave them in the style of

\# TODO (\<label\>): <\Comment> [\<Your Abbreviation\> \<Date\>] 

or just your abbreviation in case of more general comments.
Labels used so far in the project include: *Improve*, *Refactor*, *Bug*, *Document*, *Implement*. If you think we need
another category that is not covered by the current ones, please also add it here.

Last but not least: **If you made any contribution**, please also add yourself to the AUTHORS.md file ;-)

### Data

If you're missing any particular resources or you have problems finding them, please contact the developers for help.
Especially all the Stanford model stuff is highly confusing.

### Community

So far, we haven't established any official communication channels yet. We hope to soon when we gathered enough interested people
around the project!
