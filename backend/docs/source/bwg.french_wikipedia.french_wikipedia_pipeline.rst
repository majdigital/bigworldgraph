==============================================

Backstory
---------

This is sample pipeline to illustrate the project. It uses a Wikipedia dump from the French Wikipedia as a basis,
filtering all entries about affairs afterwards. The final corpus was then compiled manually to make sure to only include
relevant articles. It was created around the time of the French elections in 2017.

The pipeline comprises the following tasks:
